# Overview

This is a simple program that I created to test my skills using C++. This is my first time using C++, but I was able to use some of the new things I learned about C++.

I chose to write a hangman game. I know that C++ is popular in gaming development and so I chose to do hangman even if it just in the command line. I was able to use vectors to track my words. Then I was able to use the srand to radnomly select a word. Then used different variables to track lives and  guesses, and inside that I wanted to make sure that the user could enter uppercase and lowercase and the program would recognize it so I used the tolower() function. I then created the game loop so then the player could keep guessing different letters until they either guessed the word or ran out of lives. Then I created the end game which displays the correct message for either winning or losing the game.

I chose hangman since I wanted to learn more about writting C++ programs. I liked being able to work on something like this since I never have used the C++ before and it was simple but still challenging enough to test what I remembered learning about the C++ language. I also like naking games and having something fun once I finsih the program.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* Git / GitHub
* C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.29.30157 for x86
* Libraries: string, vector, ctime, cstdlib

# Future Work

- I do want to add a hangman or parachute guy instead of how many lives.
- make it so multiple players can play.
